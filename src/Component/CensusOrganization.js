              The Indian Census is the largest single source of a variety of
              statistical information on different characteristics of the people
              of India. With a history of more than 130 years, this reliable,
              time tested exercise has been bringing out a veritable wealth of
              statistics every 10 years, beginning from 1872 when the first
              census was conducted in India non-synchronously in different
              parts. To scholars and researchers in demography, economics,
              anthropology, sociology, statistics and many other disciplines,
              the Indian Census has been a fascinating source of data. The rich
              diversity of the people of India is truly brought out by the
              decennial census which has become one of the tools to understand
              and study India
            </p>
            <p className="para">
              The responsibility of conducting the decennial Census rests with
              the Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner, India
              under Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India. It may be of
              historical interest that though the population census of India is
              a major administrative function; the Census Organisation was set
              up on an ad-hoc basis for each Census till the 1951 Census. The
              Census Act was enacted in 1948 to provide for the scheme of
              conducting population census with duties and responsibilities of
              census officers. The Government of India decided in May 1949 to
              initiate steps for developing systematic collection of statistics
              on the size of population, its growth, etc., and established an
              organisation in the Ministry of Home Affairs under Registrar
              General and ex-Officio Census Commissioner, India. This
              organisation was made responsible for generating data on
              population statistics including Vital Statistics and Census.
              Later, this office was also entrusted with the responsibility of
              implementation of Registration of Births and Deaths Act, 1969 in
              the country.
